1. The Collision Specialist (Core Systems)
    Your Mission: Make things hit each other. This is the highest priority.
    Tasks:
        In GameManager.Update(), write a loop that checks if any Projectile in the projectiles list is touching any Enemy in the currentLevel.Enemies list.
        If a projectile hits an enemy:
            Call projectile.OnHit() to deactivate it.
            Call enemy.TakeDamage(projectile.Damage).
            Write another loop that checks if any Enemy is touching the player.
        If an enemy hits the player:
            Call player.TakeDamage(10) (or some damage value).
        (Optional) Call enemy.TakeDamage(100) to make the enemy die on impact.

2. The UI & Game State Specialist (Menus)
    Your Mission: Build the MainMenu and GameOver screens.
    Tasks:
        In GameManager.Update(), add if statements for CurrentState. If MainMenu or GameOver, stop updating the player and level.
        In GameManager.Draw(), add else if blocks. If MainMenu, draw "Press START" text. If GameOver, draw "GAME OVER" text.
        In GameManager.Update(), add logic to change the state.
        If CurrentState == MainMenu and the player presses "Enter," set CurrentState = GameState.Playing.
        If player.HP <= 0, set CurrentState = GameState.GameOver.

3. The Player & Power-Up Specialist (The "Feel")
    Your Mission: Make the player feel responsive and fun.
    Tasks:
        Implement the player's TakeDamage logic. Make the player flash or become invincible for a second after being hit.
        Implement the PowerUp.Apply() logic. You've already done this by adding AddHealth and UpgradeWeapon to the Player class.
        Add logic to PowerUp.cs so it moves. Give it an Update() method and make it fall down the screen, similar to AlienScout.  
    Files You'll Edit: Player.cs, PowerUp.cs

4. The Enemy AI Specialist (The "Challenge")Your* Mission: Make the enemies fight back.
    Tasks:
        Go to GameManager.cs. Just like you have a projectiles list for the player, add a new enemyProjectiles list.
        Modify the AlienFighter.Update() method. Add a timer (like the boss has ). When the timer is ready, make the AlienFighter shoot a new Projectile.
        Make sure to add the new enemy projectile to the enemyProjectiles list in GameManager so it can be updated and drawn.
        The Collision Specialist will need to add logic to check if enemyProjectiles hit the player.
    Files You'll Edit: AlienFighter.cs, GameManager.cs

5. The Level & Progression Specialist (The "Game")
    Your Mission: Turn the single level into a full game experience.
    Tasks:
        In GameManager.Update(), add a check: if (currentLevel.IsComplete).
        If the level is complete, increment currentLevelIndex, and call levels[currentLevelIndex].Load()  to spawn the next wave.
        Open Level.cs and create Level 3. Add new AlienFighter and AlienScout enemies in interesting patterns.
        In Enemy.TakeDamage(), when an enemy's HP goes to 0, add code to spawn a PowerUp. (e.g., if (randomNumber == 1) { gameManager.SpawnPowerUp(this.Position); }). This will require passing the GameManager to the enemy.

6. The Audio Engineer (The "Vibe")
    Your Mission: Make the game sound alive.
    Tasks:
        Create a new class: AudioManager.cs.
        Find .wav files for: shoot, enemy_hit, player_hit, explosion.
        In AudioManager, load these sounds (as SoundEffect) just like you load textures.
        Create public methods like PlayShootSound(), PlayExplosionSound().
        In GameManager, when the player shoots, call audioManager.PlayShootSound().
        In Enemy.TakeDamage, when HP goes to 0, call audioManager.PlayExplosionSound().
    Files You'll Edit: AudioManager.cs (new), GameManager.cs, Enemy.cs

7. The Art Director (The "Look")
    Your Mission: Replace all placeholder squares with final art.
    Tasks:
        Create .png files with transparent backgrounds for: player_ship, alien_scout, alien_fighter, boss_alien_dragon, player_bullet, enemy_bullet, powerup_health.
        Add all these images to the Content.mgcb file and build it.
        Go to GameManager.LoadContent(), uncomment your Content.Load lines, and load the real textures.
        Go to Player.cs, Enemy.cs, and Projectile.cs and remove the Color.Green, Color.Red, Color.Yellow from their Draw methods  so they use their natural colors.
        Adjust the Size property in each class to match the size of your new images.
